● Write sql query to find the items whose prices are higher than or equal 250rs.
Order the result by product price in descending, then product name in
ascending. Return pro_name and pro_price 

-> SELECT pro_name,pro_price FROM item_mast WHERE pro_price>=250;
-> SELECT pro_name,pro_price FROM item_mast ORDER BY pro_price DESC;
-> SELECT pro_name,pro_price FROM item_mast ORDER BY pro_name ASC;


● Write a sql query to find the cheapest item. Return pro_name and pro_price.

SELECT pro_name,pro_price
FROM item_mast
ORDER BY pro_price ASC
LIMIT 1;

● Write the sql query to calculate the average price of the items for each
company. Return average price and company code.


->  SELECT  pro_com, AVG(pro_price) FROM item_mast;


● Write the sql query to find the average total for all the product mention in the
table

SELECT AVG(pro_price)AS"Average
Total Price"
